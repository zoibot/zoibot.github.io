After working on my NES emulator for a while, I decided I wanted to try emulating something that wasn't documented as well. It's great having documentation like the nesdev wiki, but I want to try my hand at figuring out how some stuff works on my own. To that end, I'm working on a [Vectrex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vectrex) emulator. I've made some progress on the CPU but haven't gotten anything running yet.
